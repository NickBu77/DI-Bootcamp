    "- Transaction records appear to be structured. These can be used as the basis for decision making. You can use sales by time of   day, by season, by item type, by brand, etc... to determine which are the best sellers under what conditions (price range,    \n",
    "  etc...) \n",

    "  complaints from enough people, and the cost of addressing it is relatively low, then do so. But customer complaints are not \n",
    "  always representative as the angriest people have the highest likelihood to voice their opinion.\n",
    "- Social media posts are unstructured. Like customer feedback, it's harder to guage how representative they are of your customer   base. But because social media is scalable and many people have access to comments and reviews of your product, it's important   to do damage control when there are negative comments. It's also beneficial to amplify postive voices for good PR.\n",
    "- Employee work schedules, if they're sorted by employee name, hours, etc... may be structured. Employee schedules should be   \n",
    "  optimized to utilize your labor potential at peak hours (based on transaction records) and minimized during slow periods. This   will save on costs, especially since most service level jobs, like work at a radio store is flexible hours, not 9 to 5      \n",
