This was instituted in the period following January 1992  when the Russian Federation introduced a series of sweeping economic reforms including eliminating most food and reducing fuel and other subsidies  using freely fluctuating market prices  privatizing many state enterprises and working to create agrowing private sector with private land ownership. The RLMS was created because the existing data  including a Family Budget Survey  were deemed unreliable  and adequate dietary  anthropometric and various other health related behaviours were not measured in a nationally representative manner. These problems led to the initial Phase I survey of four rounds (I-IV) which was discontinued. This was the first nationally representative random sample of economic and health data ever collected in Russia  with all earlier sampling based on quotas from enterprises and other organizations.The ongoing longitudinal survey began in 1994 with the Phase II survey. In 2010  the Higher School of Economics (HSE) brought a number of the senior RLMS scholars onto its faculty and began to provide funding for the RLMS.Supplementary funding for subsequent nutrition and health-related data came from the University of North Carolina.
