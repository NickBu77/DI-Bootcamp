    "🌟 Exercise 1 : Basic Scatter Plot With Plotnine\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Objective: Create a basic scatter plot using Plotnine to visualize the relationship between two variables.\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a pandas DataFrame with two columns, x and y, each containing 20 random numbers.\n",
    "Use Plotnine to create a scatter plot of y versus x.\n",
    "Add x and y-axis labels as ‘X-Value’ and ‘Y-Value’, respectively. Also, add a plot title ‘Basic Scatter Plot’.\n",
    "Expected Outcome: A scatter plot displaying the relationship between the data in x and y, with appropriate labels and title.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 Exercise 2 : Bar Plot Of Categorical Data With Plotnine\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Objective: Use Plotnine to create a bar plot showing the frequency of categories in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate a pandas DataFrame with a column category, containing 30 random entries from a set of categories (e.g., ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’).\n",
    "Create a bar plot that shows the count of each category using Plotnine.\n",
    "Customize the plot by adding a title ‘Category Frequency’ and x and y-axis labels.\n",
    "Expected Outcome: A bar plot displaying the frequency of each category in the dataset, with clear labels and a descriptive title.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 Exercise 3 : Line Plot With Multiple Lines With Plotnine\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Objective: Create a line plot using Plotnine that compares two different data series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a pandas DataFrame with three columns: x, y1, and y2, where x is a sequence of numbers and y1, y2 are two different mathematical functions of x (e.g., sin(x) and cos(x)).\n",
    "Plot y1 and y2 against x in the same plot, using different colors for each line.\n",
    "Add a legend to distinguish between the two lines, and label axes as ‘X-Value’, ‘Y-Value’, and add a title ‘Comparison of Two Functions’.\n",
    "Expected Outcome: A line plot that effectively compares the two functions across the range of x, with a legend, axis labels, and a title.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 Exercise 4 : Basic Line Chart With Plotly\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Create a basic line chart using Plotly to visualize the trend of sales over 12 months. Assume the following monthly sales data:\n",
    "\n",
    "months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']\n",
    "sales = [200, 210, 250, 300, 320, 340, 360, 380, 390, 400, 420, 440]\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "- Import Plotly’s graph_objects as go.\n",
    "- Create a line chart with months on the x-axis and sales on the y-axis.\n",
    "- Add a title to the chart: “Monthly Sales Data”.\n",
    "- Display the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 Exercise 5 : Bar Chart With Customization With Plotly\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Using Plotly, create a bar chart to represent the number of books sold in different genres. Use the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "genres = ['Fiction', 'Non-Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Mystery', 'Biography']\n",
    "books_sold = [120, 150, 90, 80, 130]\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Import Plotly’s graph_objects as go.\n",
    "Create a bar chart with genres on the x-axis and books_sold on the y-axis.\n",
    "Customize the bar colors.\n",
    "Add a title to the chart: “Books Sold by Genre”.\n",
    "Display the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 Exercise 6 : Scatter Plot With Size And Color Dimensions With Plotly\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between Age, Salary, and Years of Experience in a dataset. Assume the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "data = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40, 45],\n",
    "    'Salary': [50000, 60000, 70000, 80000, 90000],\n",
    "    'Years of Experience': [2, 5, 7, 10, 12]\n",
    "})\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Import Plotly’s express as px.\n",
    "Create a scatter plot with Age on the x-axis, Salary on the y-axis.\n",
    "Use Years of Experience to determine the size of each marker.\n",
    "Add a title to the chart: “Relationship between Age, Salary, and Experience”.\n",
    "Display the plot.\n"
